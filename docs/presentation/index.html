            My name is Jason Biegel, I am a software engineer, aspiring indoor farmer, and volunteer with the Assocation for Vertical Farming. I have been working with others in the indoor farming industry to design an open source plant recipe standard. What is a plant recipe you might ask?<br>

            <aside class="notes">
              Growers of any level, from hobbyists to farmers, utilize plant recipes to know what environmental conditions are needed to get the best yield possible. As more technology is incorporated into the growing process to monitor and control environment conditions, there needs to be a way for a control system to know what the desired conditions are.<br>

              The plant recipe group of the AVF began by figuring out what information about plant growth are important and measurable using tools available to growers.

              The environmental conditions which can be measured and adjusted by growers or autmated control systems. One of the major advantages to indoor growing is the amound of control you have over the environmental conditions for you plants. We split these conditions into three categories: air, water, and light.<br>

            <aside class="notes">
              Water metrics play a big role hydroponic growing. Most importantly, pH and the soluble element concentration which is typically measured as electro conductivity. To be more accurate, you could also measure the mass concentration of specific elements. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium being the most important elements for plant growth, but there many other to consider as well.<br>

            <aside class="notes">
              Light emits photons onto plants which causes photosynthesis. Photons have wavelengths which are measured in nanometers. Some wavelengths are more desirable than other such and red and blue. There is also an intensity for each wavelength that can be measured. Additionally, white light can vary in how warm or cool the light appears. The color temperature of the white light can also dramatically affect plant growth.

            <aside class="notes">
              Because ideal conditions can change during a plant growing process, we made the structure of the data format contain different stages so conditions can be different depending on the age of the plant. Conditions can also vary depending on the time of day, for example only providing light to plants for some parts of the day.<br>
