            <h3>What are plant recipes?</h3>

            <p>Instructions on how to grow plants</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              * Alan<br>
              Growers of any level, from hobbyists to farmers, utilize plant recipes to know what environmental conditions are needed to get the best yield possible. As more technology is incorporated into the growing process to monitor and control environment conditions, there needs to be a way for a control system to know what the desired conditions are.<br>

              The plant recipe group of the AVF began by figuring out what information about plant growth are important and measurable using tools available to growers.

            <h2>What information do recipes contain?</h2>

            <aside class="notes">
              The environmental conditions which can be measured and adjusted by growers or autmated control systems. One of the major advantages to indoor growing is the amound of control you have over the environmental conditions for you plants. We split these conditions into three categories: air, water, and light.<br>

            <p>Relative Humidity</p>
            <p>Carbon Dioxide</p>
            
            <aside class="notes">
              Air metrics measure conditions in the air around the plants.<br>

            <h2>Water Metrics</h2>

            <p>Electro Conductivity</p>
            <p>Minerals and Soluble Nutrients</p>
            <p>pH</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              Water metrics play a big role hydroponic growing. Most importantly, pH and the soluble element concentration which is typically measured as electro conductivity. To be more accurate, you could also measure the mass concentration of specific elements. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium being the most important elements for plant growth, but there many other to consider as well.<br>
            </aside>

          <section>
            <h2>Light Metrics</h2>
            <p>Intensity</p>
            <p>Wavelength</p>
            <p>Correlated Color Temperature</p>
            
            <img src="img/light-charts.png" />

            <aside class="notes">
              Light emits photons onto plants which causes photosynthesis. Photons have wavelengths which are measured in nanometers. Some wavelengths are more desirable than other such and red and blue. There is also an intensity for each wavelength that can be measured. Additionally, white light can vary in how warm or cool the light appears. The color temperature of the white light can also dramatically affect plant growth.

            <aside class="notes">
              Because ideal conditions can change during a plant growing process, we made the structure of the data format contain different stages so conditions can be different depending on the age of the plant. Conditions can also vary depending on the time of day, for example only providing light to plants for some parts of the day.<br>

            <h2>Creating the Default Stage</h2>
            <p>Each recipe includes a default stage for defining default metrics.</p>
            <p>Metrics can be defined by a tolerable range or precise value.</p>
            <pre>
              <code class="xml" data-trim>
                &lt;recipe&gt;

              </code>
            </pre>

            <aside class="notes">The recipe begins by defining defaults metrics. This will encapsulate the baseline settings for each of our nutrients and metrics. When we give a metric, we can define a tolerable range, for what's acceptable for one of our nutrients, or we can specify a precise value.</aside>

              For each of the non-default stages we can include Start and End times, based on a 24 hour cycle.<br>
              Or.. even add day duration for how long the stage should be defined.<br>
              This needs to be discussed during the call on wednesday, or earlier.

              Now we're going to go through an exercise of writing a recipe in XML.<br>
              Ideally, recipes would be created and maintained through a UI.<br>
              However, writing recipes manually in XML is not too painful.<br>
              I found some instructions on growing tomatoes online.<br>
              The link to the webpage I got the instructions from is at the bottom of this slide
              incase anyone is interested in growing tomatoes themselves<br>
              **go through text**<br>
              Now lets add some more metrics about water that will be absorbed by the tomato roots<br>
              We can specify the pH range that we want the water to be (5.8 to 6.3)<br>
              We can also specify the electro-conductivity range (2 to 3.5)<br>

              In the software industry, the valuable information is the source code, not the programming language of the source code. Similarly, the valuable information in plant recipes is the evironmental conditions, not the format of the data.

              Experimenting with different environmental conditions is a big part of growing to find the best yield. Using a text format to store plant recipe data will let growers leverage version control to manage recipe experimentation. If you familiar with git, this could be done in the form of branches.

              The challenge of this is do we start having farming use this format, or do we have software manufacturers incorporate this format.

              Because this is an open source initiative, anyone who is interested can get involved in developing the plant standard. Currently, we are keeping our technical progress in a GitHub repository.
