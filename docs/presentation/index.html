            My name is Jason Biegel, I am a software engineer, aspiring indoor farmer, and volunteer with the Assocation for Vertical Farming. I have been working with others in the indoor farming industry to design an open source plant recipe standard. What is a plant recipe you might ask?<br>

            <p class="fragment">Instructions on how to grow plants</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              Growers of any level, from hobbyists to farmers, utilize plant recipes to know what environmental conditions are needed to get the best yield possible. As more technology is incorporated into the growing process to monitor and control environment conditions, there needs to be a way for a control system to know what the desired conditions are.<br>

              The plant recipe group of the AVF began by figuring out what information about plant growth are important and measurable using tools available to growers.

            <aside class="notes">
              The environmental conditions which can be measured and adjusted by growers or autmated control systems. One of the major advantages to indoor growing is the amound of control you have over the environmental conditions for you plants. We split these conditions into three categories: air, water, and light.<br>

            <aside class="notes">
              Water metrics play a big role hydroponic growing. Most importantly, pH and the soluble element concentration which is typically measured as electro conductivity. To be more accurate, you could also measure the mass concentration of specific elements. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium being the most important elements for plant growth, but there many other to consider as well.<br>

            <aside class="notes">
              Light emits photons onto plants which causes photosynthesis. Photons have wavelengths which are measured in nanometers. Some wavelengths are more desirable than other such and red and blue. There is also an intensity for each wavelength that can be measured.

            <aside class="notes">
              Because ideal conditions can change during a plant growing process, we made the structure of the data format contain different stages so conditions can be different depending on the age of the plant. Conditions can also vary depending on the time of day, for example only providing light to plants for some parts of the day.<br>

              There are many great products on the market for monitoring controling growing areas. However, each one of these products have propietary formats for storing grow recipes. Growers might also come up with their own format to store plant recipe data such as Excel. This limits the capabilities of what can be done with grow recipes.<br>

              If plant recipes are stored in a structured format that is friendly for software development, it becomes much more versatile.<br>

              In the software industry, the valuable information is the source code, not the programming language of the source code. Similarly, the valuable information in plant recipes is the evironmental conditions, not the format of the data.

              Experimenting with different environmental conditions is a big part of growing to find the best yield. Using a text format to store plant recipe data will let growers leverage version control to manage recipe experimentation. If you familiar with git, this could be done in the form of branches.
